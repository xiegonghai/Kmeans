# Kmeans
abstract:
  Simple Kmeans algorithm, Implemented in C++ï¼ŒSupport "sqeuclidean","cosine","haming distance". 

run main.cpp
if you want to use this in you project, you can add new namespace and add these function to your own project.

further:
this algorithm not give an very efficient implementation, if you need, you can use kd-tree or ball tree,
combine with parallel implementation.

try to merge some categories to reduce the Total SSE will be better if you don't know the number of specific categories.
